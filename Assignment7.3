Here, n(no of trials) = 20, 
n - k = 5  (no of count of failures)
k(count of success in n trials) = 20 - 5 = 15

Here the probability of success = probability of giving a right answer = s = 1/4=0.25

Hence, the probability of failure = probability of giving a wrong answer = 1 - s 
= 1 - 1/4 = 3/4=0.75

When we substitute these values in the formula for Binomial distribution we get,

P =((n!)*(s)^k*(1-s)^(n-k))/(k!)*(n-k)!

P (5 out of 20) = ((20!)*(0.25)^15*(0.75)^5)/(5!)*(15!)
P(5)= 0.0000034 (approximately)

Thus the required probability is 0.0000034 approximately.
